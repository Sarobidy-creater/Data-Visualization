# üìä Company Sales Data Analysis  

## üìå Description  
This project analyzes company sales data using Python and Matplotlib to visualize various trends in product sales and total profits over a 12-month period. The dataset includes sales figures for six different products, as well as total units sold and total profit.

- **total_units** - Total units sold per month.  
- **total_profit** - Total profit earned each month.
